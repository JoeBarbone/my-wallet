# Final Project - My Wallet
This is the final project required to complete the bootcamp. The idea for this project came when I thought I had lost my wallet. I freaked out a bit and didn't know exactly what I had in my wallet and who I would have to call to cancel all of my bank cards, credit cards, etc.  

The purpose of this app is to create a simple place that will contain the contents of your wallet. In the event that you really do lose your wallet, you will know exactly who to contact and how.

## User Story

AS A user, I am looking for a web app to store my wallet contents  

SO THAT if I lose my wallet, I will know who to contact and how to contact them  

AS A user, I worry about security  

I WANT an app that is safe and does not store personal identifying information such as card numbers, experation dates or safety codes

## Acceptance Criteria

WHEN I visit the website  
THEN I am presented with a main page with a small blurb about the app and an option to login or signup   
WHEN I signup  
THEN I will see a signup page asking for first name, last name, email address and password  
WHEN I login    
THEN I will see a screen that contains my "cards"  
WHEN I select "add", I will be presented with a screen to add card title, card issuer, card type and card number  
WHEN I select "save" after adding the new card information, the new card information will be saved to the current users card list  
WHEN I click "update", I will be able to update card title, card issuer, card type and card number  
WHEN I click "delete" the selected card will be removed
